# Part I, Building an Architecture to Support Domain Modeling
1. Domain modeling and DDD <br>
  The domain is a fancy way of saying the problem you're trying to solve.
  The domain model is the mental map that business owners have of their businesses.
   1. Encapsulation and abstraction
      1. simplifying behavior <br>
         We encapsulate behavior by identifying a task that needs to be done in our code and giving that task to a well-defined object or function (an abstraction).<br>
         Encapsulating behavior by using abstractions is a powerful tool to making code more expressive, more testable, and easier to maintain.
      2. hiding data
   2. The dependency inversion principle
      1. Depends on doesn't mean imports or call, necessarily, but rather a more general idea that one module knows about or needs an other module 
   3. Whenever we have a business concept that has data but no identity, we often choose to represent it using the Value Object pattern. A value object is any domain object that is uniquely identified by the data it holds; we usually make them immutable.
   4. We use the term entity to describe a domain that has long-lived identity.
   5. Exceptions can express domain concepts too
   6. Domain services are not the same thing as the services from the service layer. Although they are often closed related. A domain service represents a business concept or process, whereas a service-layer service represents a use case for you application. Often the service layer will call a domain service.
2. Repository, Service Layer, and Unit of Work patterns
   1. Building fakes your abstractions is an excellent way to get design feedback. if it's hard to fake, the abstraction is probably too complicated
   2. Ports and adapters came out of the OO word, and the definition we hold onto is that the port is the interface between our application and whatever it is we wish to abstract away, and the adapter is the implementation behind that interface or abstraction.
   3. Apply dependency inversion to your ORM
   4. Our domain model should be free of infrastructure concerns, so your ORM should import your model, and not the other way around.
   5. Functional Core, Imperative shell
3. Some thoughts about testing and abstractions
   1. Designing for testability really means designing for extensibility,
   2. Mock -> London-School TDD
   3. Fake are working implementations of the thing they're replacing, but they're designed for use only in tests. They wouldn't work "in real life"; our in-memory repository is a good example. But you can use them to make assertions about the end state of a system rather than the behaviours along the way, so they're associated with classic-style TDD
   4. Mocks Aren't Stubs
   5. We can make our systems easier to test and maintain by simplifying the interface between our business logic and messy IO
